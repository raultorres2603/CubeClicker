# CubeClicker

A web-based, online, real-time, multi-client clicker game — connected clients see each other's live activity.

## Prerequisites

- **Running the environment:** Podman with a working compose provider (`podman compose`). No other host prerequisites.
- **Running the tooling commands (`npm …`):** Node.js 24 LTS + npm.

## Quickstart

```bash
podman compose up
```

This builds and starts the full local environment (backend + frontend containers) with hot reload:

| Surface | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | http://localhost:5173 |
| Backend | http://localhost:8080 |
| WebSocket | ws://localhost:8080/ws |

- Background: `podman compose up -d`
- First run, or after dependency/manifest changes: `podman compose up --build`
- Stop: `podman compose down`

Both ports are bound to loopback (`127.0.0.1`) only.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm ci` | install dependencies from the committed lockfile |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript, no emit |
| `npm test` | Vitest unit tests, all workspaces |
| `npm run coverage` | Vitest with V8 coverage in all workspaces (thresholds ≥ 80% statements/branches/functions/lines per workspace) |
| `npm run build` | build all workspaces |
| `npm run dev` | start the full local environment with hot reload (equivalent to `podman compose up`) |
| `npm run smoke` | containerized end-to-end smoke test (equivalent to `podman compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.smoke.yaml run --rm smoke`) |

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | `8080` | host port published for the backend container (`127.0.0.1:${BACKEND_PORT}:8080`) |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | `5173` | host port published for the frontend container (`127.0.0.1:${FRONTEND_PORT}:5173`) |
| `VITE_WS_URL` | `ws://localhost:8080/ws` | WebSocket URL the frontend connects to |

The defaults work out of the box. `.env` files are user-owned and are not used by this scaffold — export a variable in your shell instead, e.g. `BACKEND_PORT=9090 podman compose up`.

## Production images

```bash
podman build --format docker --target prod -f src/backend/Dockerfile .
podman build --format docker --target prod -f src/frontend/Dockerfile .
```

The `--format docker` form keeps the image `HEALTHCHECK`, which Podman 5's default OCI build format would drop.

Both images are provider-neutral and are the deployable artifacts. Release tagging is deferred to deployment time.

## Stack

TypeScript (strict) on Node.js 24 LTS: a Fastify backend (HTTP health at `GET /healthz`, WebSocket at `GET /ws`) and a React + Vite frontend, in an npm-workspaces repo (`src/backend`, `src/frontend`) tested with Vitest and linted with ESLint. The frontend connects to the backend over WebSocket; the containerized smoke test (`npm run smoke`) proves that path through the container network with two concurrent clients.
